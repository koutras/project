My BSc thesis in the area of VLSI, implementing a microprogrammable system in VHDL, on ALTERA cyclone DE2
 that is in essence, a stripped 8bit CPU with a microsequencer, that can be microprogrammed to support a custom instruction set,
 A VGA visual display has been added as well using code from Hamblen. The microsystem can be used as is
 for educational purposes as well as a base to create a more advanced cpu.
